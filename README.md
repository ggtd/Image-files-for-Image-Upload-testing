- Repo: https://github.com/ggtd/Image-files-for-Image-Upload-testing

# The Motivation:
I had to test image Upload on a web application.
Rather that using random image files from the internet. I decided to, create placeholder image files (JPG, GIF, PNG).

## Secondary motivation
To save your and me 5 minutes, next time you need images for testing upload in web applications.

# Images sizes (in pixels):
- 80x80
- 250x250
- 1000x1000

# Image File Formats:
- jpg
- gif
- png

### TODO:
- [x] Basic (small) image size. For testing formats.
- [ ] Extra Large image files. For testing limits.
- [ ] Consider .jpeg file extension.
